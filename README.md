# FonSim

## Simple Assembly Language Simulator

FonSim is a basic assembly language simulator written in Java. It simulates the behavior of a simple processor with features including arithmetic, logical, and memory operations.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Logical Operations**: Bitwise AND and OR.
- **Memory Operations**: Loading from and storing to memory.
- **Control Flow**: Jump instructions to alter the sequence of execution.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the simulator.
- **Conditional Jumps**: Conditional jumps based on equality, inequality, and relational operators.

## Instructions

- `MOV r1, imm` (0x01): Move an immediate value to register `r1`.
- `ADD r1, r2, addr` (0x02): Add the value of register `r2` to the value from memory at address `addr` and store the result in `r1`.
- `SUB r1, r2, addr` (0x03): Subtract the value from memory at address `addr` from the value of register `r2` and store the result in `r1`.
- `MUL r1, r2, addr` (0x04): Multiply the value of register `r2` by the value from memory at address `addr` and store the result in `r1`.
- `DIV r1, r2, addr` (0x05): Divide the value of register `r2` by the value from memory at address `addr` and store the result in `r1`.
- `AND r1, r2, addr` (0x06): Perform a bitwise AND on the values of registers `r2` and `addr` and store the result in `r1`.
- `OR r1, r2, addr` (0x07): Perform a bitwise OR on the values of registers `r2` and `addr` and store the result in `r1`.
- `STORE r1, addr` (0x08): Store the value of register `r1` into memory at the specified address `addr`.
- `LOAD r1, addr` (0x09): Load the value from memory at the specified address `addr` into register `r1`.
- `JMP addr` (0x0A): Jump to the specified address `addr` in the program.
- `JMPE r1, r2, addr` (0x0B): Conditional jump to address `addr` if the value of register `r1` equals the value of register `r2`.
- `JMPN r1, r2, addr` (0x0C): Conditional jump to address `addr` if the value of register `r1` does not equal the value of register `r2`.
- `JMPG r1, r2, addr` (0x0D): Conditional jump to address `addr` if the value of register `r1` is greater than the value of register `r2`.
- `JMPL r1, r2, addr` (0x0E): Conditional jump to address `addr` if the value of register `r1` is less than the value of register `r2`.
- `NOOP` (0xFF): No operation.

## Usage

1. **Download the Executable:**
   - Download the `.exe` file from the [releases page](URL_TO_RELEASES_PAGE).

2. **Create a Program File:**
   - Create a file (for example) `myProgram.txt` with your instructions, each on a new line. For example:
     ```
     MOV R1, 10
     MOV R2, 5
     ADD R1, R2, 0
     STORE R1, 0
     LOAD R1, 0
     JMP 0
     ```

3. **Run the Simulator:**
   - Double-click the `.exe` file to start the simulator.

## Notes

- The simulator uses a busy-wait loop to simulate delays; you can adjust or remove this as needed.
- Feel free to modify and extend the simulator according to your needs. Happy coding!
